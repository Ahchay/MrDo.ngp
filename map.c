//slight change of plan here...
//this data model basically represents the "filled" tiles
//which is fine as far as it goes; the code is...
//1 = background
//2 = Cherry
//4 = Apple
//8 = Beastie spawn
//16 = Mr Do! spawn

//The only problem is that this doesn't cater for the "gaps" when
//the player carves out the screen (or the walls between empty
//blocks) like this:

//XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXX     XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXX  X  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXX  X  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXX     XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXX  X  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
//XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

//Sort of thing...

//So...
//Instead of modelling the map based on what is filled in...
//we'll model it based on what has been carved out...

#define WallNone 0x0

#define WallTop 0x1
#define WallRight 0x2
#define WallBottom 0x4
#define WallLeft 0x8

#define MapCherry 0x10
#define MapApple 0x20

//1 = top of block missing
//2 = right of block missing
//4 = bottom of block missing
//8 = left of block missing
//16 = cherry
//32 = apple
//64 = beastie
//128 = mr do!

//so our map above would look like:

//& there is a maximum of five apples per level. ok.

#define MAXLEVELS 3
